# ArgData

ArgData is a .NET library for working with [Microprose Formula One Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_Grand_Prix_(video_game) (F1GP) data, such as car colors and driver performance. There is also support for working with various other game files, such as reading/writing name files and car setups.

This library currently supports the European and US (World Circuit) version 1.05 of the game.

It is used in the new F1GP editor [ArgEditor](http://manicomio.se/argeditor).
