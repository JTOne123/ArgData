# ArgData

ArgData is a .NET library for working with Microprose Formula One Grand Prix (F1GP) data, such as car colors and driver skills. There is also support for working with various other game files, such as reading/writing name files and car setups.

This library currently supports the European and US (World Circuit) version 1.05 of the game.

This library is used in the new F1GP editor [ArgEditor](http://manicomio.se/argeditor).


### API usage

For some examples in how to use the library, see [examples](EXAMPLES.md).


### Acknowledgements

The checksum calculation code is based on some C++ code I received from Paul Hoad (of GP2 Track Editor fame) in 1998.
