GenerateDocs.ps1 uses reflection and the XML documentation to generate the API reference
PostProcessSite.ps1 removes unwanted menu items from the generated HTML files

The ps-modules folder has functionality used by GenerateDocs.ps1 and PostProcessSite.ps1.
It may appear modular, but it leaves a lot to be desired on that front... :)
