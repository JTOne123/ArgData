# PowerShell Tutorial Prerequisites

Before you can use play around with ArgData from a PowerShell, you will need
to download the actual ArgData library.

The latest version of ArgData can be downloaded here: [ArgData latest version](/downloads/argdata/ArgData.0.19.0.zip)

The recommended version of ArgData to use with PowerShell is the one
for .NET Framework 4.5. 
When you unzip the downloaded file, the created folder will contain several subfolders.
Look in the one called **net45**, this is the one for .NET Framework 4.5.
There you will find the ArgData.dll file.

In all tutorials, we will assume that you have downloaded the latest version
of the ArgData.DLL and placed it in `C:\Scripts\ArgData\` and that
your script files will be located in the same folder.

However, you may choose to place it whereever you want. Just remember to use _your_ folder
when following the tutorials.
